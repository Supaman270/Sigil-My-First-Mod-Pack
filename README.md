Welcome to my first (and prolly crappy) attempt at a modpack!
It does require Steamodded and Lovely.
So far I've only added one joker, but when my artist (thank you so much Tuzzo) gets back from vacation, I'll add more.
I also wanna give a huge shoutout to nekojoe and someone23832 on the Balatro Discord.
I post updates of this modpack in one of the threads in the Balatro University Discord if you wanna check it out.
Stay tuned for more content!
